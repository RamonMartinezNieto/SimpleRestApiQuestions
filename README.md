# SimpleRestApiQuestions


**Hello there!** 

I made this app only for fun, to practice how to create a API Rest using the better ways that I know currently. 


The API Rest is an API that is communicate with a data base (MySql in my case) and give you all that you need to create any category of questions. 
You need a Jason Web Token to use the methods POST and DELTE, but the GET methods are open. 

Welll.... You can prove the API in heroku. 
Sometimes I close the deployment on heroku because I don't have the plan to pay for it, if you want to see the swagger doc. hit me out.


*Next step:* Way to marge (using PR or automatic merge) with the master branch when all test are passed in GitHub Actions

## PLEASE HELP ME!!!
