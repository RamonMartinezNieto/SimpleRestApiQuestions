# SimpleRestApiQuestions

Hello there! 

I made this app only for fun, to practice how to create a API Rest using the better ways that I know currently. 


The API Rest is an API that is communicate with a data base (MySql in my case) and give you all that you need to create any category of questions. 
You need a Jason Web Token to use the methods POST and DELTE, but the GET methods are open. 

Welll.... You can prove the API in heroku. 
Sometimes I close the deployment on heroku because I don't have the plan to pay for it, if you want to see the swagger doc. hit me out.


Note: I have continuous deployment on heroku using the master branch, and I want to add continuous integration to pass tests and create the pull request if the test passed ande merge a develop branch with the master branch. 

I don't know how to do it yet, I spend two days learning about GitHub Actions, but I think so that the preview .Net 6 is my problem currently. 
I have no idea how to do it Y_Y... 

## PLEASE HELP ME!!!
